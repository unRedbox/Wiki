# UnRedbox Wiki

Welcome to the **UnRedbox Wiki** repository. This project is focused on hosting and documenting information extracted from a **Redbox Kiosks**. Our goal is to explore and understand the software and configuration of the kiosk system, while also preserving and sharing our findings.

## Project Overview

The UnRedbox project aims to demystify the inner workings of the Redbox kiosks. This repository serves as a central wiki for:

- **Hardware documentation**: Gathering information about the various hardware implementations.
- **System configuration**: Understanding the settings and behavior of the system.
- **Security considerations**: Insights into potential vulnerabilities or interesting features.

Please note that this project is for educational and research purposes only.

### [Before You Contribute](https://redbox.wiki/en/contributing)

All contributions are licensed under the **Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International license**. This includes media uploads, text contributions, or anything else submitted to the wiki. You may not license any contributions under any other terms.

### Site Navigation

The navigation panel on the side of the website is controlled by redbox.wiki admins. If you'd like a page to appear in the navigation, please contact **codeHusky/Loki** on Discord.

### New Pages

Before adding a new page, ensure that an existing page doesn't already cover the topic you're looking to work on. If there's overlap, see if it's more appropriate to add to an existing page rather than creating a new one. We aim to keep the number of pages minimal while avoiding excessively long pages of documentation.

If you still need to create a new page, feel free to do so. Just make sure you contact **codeHusky/Loki** in the Redbox Tinkering Discord to have your new page added to the navigation.

### Writing Tone and Style

All contributions should use a professional tone. Avoid using terms like "I" or referring to yourself directly. If you're documenting a technique you created, feel free to credit yourself, but avoid taking credit for "discovering" things that exist in every kiosk.
